## Using fine-tuned **CodeBERT** for Vulnerability Detection, Severity Scoring, and Fix Suggestions

Our approach, utilizing **CodeBERT**, provides several key advantages over traditional static analysis tools like **SonarQube**, **MobSF**, **Synk** and **Android Lint**:

### 1. **Context-Aware Analysis**
   - **CodeBERT Approach**: CodeBERT uses pre-trained machine learning models that understand the semantics of code and natural language, capturing deeper context, relationships, and intent behind the code.
   - **Existing Tools**: SonarQube, MobSF, Android Lint, and Snyk often operate on **superficial pattern matching** or syntax-based rules, leading to potential **misinterpretation of code** if certain nuances or broader program logic aren’t captured. They may flag issues that are not vulnerabilities simply because they match predefined patterns.

### 2. **Machine Learning-Based Generalization**
   - **CodeBERT Approach**: Fine-tuning on real-world vulnerability data allows CodeBERT to evolve and detect **new or rare vulnerabilities**, even if they haven’t been explicitly modeled in the past. This generalization is powerful because the model adapts and improves as new vulnerabilities are added to the dataset.
   - **Existing Tools**:
     - **SonarQube/MobSF/Android Lint**: These tools need **constant updates** from their vendors or community to add new rules for detecting vulnerabilities. Their detection capabilities are only as good as the most recent ruleset.
     - **Snyk**: While Snyk does offer automatic updates to its vulnerability database, it primarily focuses on known vulnerabilities in libraries and packages. Snyk’s coverage is good for **dependencies** but not as effective for detecting vulnerabilities in **custom code**.

### 3. **Handling Code in the Wild**
   - **CodeBERT Approach**: The model can be trained across **multiple languages** and can generalize across different codebases, meaning it can be fine-tuned for **legacy systems**, custom frameworks, or proprietary languages that aren’t widely supported.
   - **Existing Tools**:
     - **SonarQube**: Primarily optimized for major languages but less effective in detecting vulnerabilities in less common or custom languages. Adding new language support is often cumbersome.
     - **MobSF**: While powerful for mobile applications, it’s tailored to mobile codebases, and extending its support for other non-mobile-specific vulnerabilities is limited.
     - **Snyk**: Focuses on dependencies and libraries, often leaving custom-built application code out of the vulnerability scanning process.
     - **Android Lint**: Strictly focused on Android applications, offering little flexibility for other environments.

### 4. **Better Fix Suggestions**
   - **CodeBERT Approach**: Fix suggestions are derived from historical data of actual fixes, making them **context-aware**, relevant, and applicable to the specific code at hand. This makes the suggestions more accurate and tailored to the identified vulnerabilities.
   - **Existing Tools**:
     - **SonarQube**: Fix suggestions are often **rigid and generic**, based on templates that may not take the specific context into account.
     - **MobSF/Android Lint**: Provide some guidance, but fixes are rule-based and may **miss context**, offering only basic hints that lack clarity.
     - **Snyk**: Fixes focus on **dependency updates** and upgrading libraries rather than addressing vulnerabilities in the custom code. While this is useful for third-party dependencies, it’s not helpful for vulnerabilities in the application’s core logic.

### 5. **Severity Scoring**
   - **CodeBERT Approach**: CodeBERT’s machine learning-based severity scoring considers **context** (e.g., how exposed the vulnerability is, interdependencies) to assign **accurate risk scores**.
   - **Existing Tools**:
     - **SonarQube**: Severity is assigned based on **static rules**, which may not always align with real-world risk, leading to **misprioritization** of vulnerabilities.
     - **MobSF**: Severity scoring is often **basic** and does not take broader program context into account, limiting its effectiveness in prioritizing vulnerabilities.
     - **Snyk**: Focuses more on **known vulnerabilities** in dependencies, and its severity scoring is more effective for open-source projects but not necessarily for complex, custom codebases.

### 6. **Lower False Positive Rate**
   - **CodeBERT Approach**: By understanding the context and intent behind code, CodeBERT can **reduce false positives** significantly. It avoids flagging non-issues that match superficial patterns but aren’t true vulnerabilities.
   - **Existing Tools**:
     - **SonarQube/MobSF/Android Lint**: These tools can **generate a high number of false positives** because they rely on matching specific patterns without understanding the surrounding context. This leads to **alert fatigue**, causing developers to waste time reviewing non-critical issues.
     - **Snyk**: Since it focuses on known vulnerabilities in libraries, Snyk’s false positive rate is lower in this specific area, but it doesn’t handle **custom code** vulnerabilities as effectively.

### 7. **Adaptability to Custom Use Cases**
   - **CodeBERT Approach**: Easily adaptable to custom or enterprise-specific needs. It can be fine-tuned using internal codebases and specific vulnerability patterns, allowing for **highly tailored solutions**.
   - **Existing Tools**:
     - **SonarQube**: Customization is possible but requires **writing custom rules** manually, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.
     - **MobSF**: Primarily focused on mobile applications, with limited flexibility for custom extensions or non-mobile use cases.
     - **Snyk**: Highly specialized in dependency management, and while it integrates well with CI/CD pipelines, its adaptability for custom vulnerability detection in core application code is limited.

### 8. **Comprehensive Analysis**
   - **CodeBERT Approach**: Combines vulnerability detection, severity scoring, and fix suggestions into a **single unified framework**. This holistic view allows organizations to **streamline their security workflows**.
   - **Existing Tools**:
     - **SonarQube**: Great for **code quality** but often lacks depth when it comes to **security vulnerabilities**.
     - **MobSF**: Focuses heavily on **mobile security** and may miss vulnerabilities in **server-side logic** or back-end code.
     - **Android Lint**: Strictly for Android code, with limited features for non-mobile projects.
     - **Snyk**: Primarily concerned with vulnerabilities in **third-party libraries**, meaning it may leave **first-party code** unchecked.

### Conclusion:
The **CodeBERT-based approach** provides a **machine learning-powered**, **context-aware** solution that improves vulnerability detection, **prioritizes issues** effectively, and offers **relevant fixes**. In contrast, **SonarQube**, **MobSF**, **Android Lint**, and **Snyk** have limitations due to their reliance on static rules, lack of context-awareness, and higher false positive rates. Moreover, CodeBERT’s adaptability to **custom scenarios** and **multi-language support** makes it a more flexible and future-proof option for comprehensive security analysis.
